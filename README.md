# Analysis and Prediction of Penguins

This project uses Streamlit to build an interactive web application for exploring and predicting penguin species based on various features. It leverages the seaborn library for data visualization, pandas for data manipulation, and scikit-learn for machine learning.

## Features

- **Data Exploration**: Visualize the distribution of penguin species.
- **Model Training**: Train a RandomForestClassifier to predict penguin species.
- **Model Evaluation**: Display the accuracy and classification report of the model.
- **User Interaction**: Allow users to input features and get predictions for penguin species.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed. You can install the required packages using pip:

```sh
pip install streamlit pandas seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Run Project
```sh
streamlit run app.py
